For this assignment you should read the task, then below the task do what it asks you to do
based on what the task tells you do first.
EXAMPLE TASK:
'''
#EX) Declare a variable set to 3. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 0.
i = 3;
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1

'''While Loops'''
#1) Declare a variable set to 4. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 1.
x=4

for x in range(4, 1):
    print(x)




#2) Declare a variable set to 14. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and increments the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 20.

y = 14
while y!=(21):
    print(y)
    y += 1
    if (y==21):
        break


#3) Declare a variable set to 55. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#   you just created. Then make an if statement that makes the loop break when
#   the variable is equal to 50. 


z=35
while z!=(51):
    print(z)
    z += 1
    if (z==51): 
        break
'''For Loops'''
#4) Create a list named sports. Put three sports into the list. Create
#   a for loop that prints each sport in the list

sports = ["Basketball","Soccer", "Baseball"]
for i in list:
        print(i)

#5) Create a for loop that loops through each letter in a string of one of your
#   favorite songs. Each iteration should print should a letter of the word. 




#6) Create a list named movies. Put five of your favorite movies into the list.
#   However, make sure one of the movies is Avatar. 
#   Create a for loop that iterates over the list. In the loop print the movie
#   being looped over, but create an if statement that breaks out of the 
#   loop if it is Avatar.
